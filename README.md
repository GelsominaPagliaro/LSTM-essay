This study delves into the application of deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, in forecasting financial time series. It addresses the limitations of traditional methods like ARIMA in handling non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies. By emphasizing the advantages of deep neural networks, particularly LSTM's ability to preserve long-term memory and mitigate gradient problems, the study explores how these models can enhance forecasting accuracy in financial markets.
